Welcome to my IT3038c-scripts github repo, accessed both from my UC Sandbox Linux instance and a local instance of Linux run via oraclebox vm on my win10 home computer, both accessing github via SSH.

This repo contains various projects from the labs and assignments throughout the semester. I've really enjoyed working with this, and I am working on growing familiar with my own local linux instance in order to practice working with the OS from home. 

I've really enjoyed this class and these scripts will serve as a useful resource for me in the future.
